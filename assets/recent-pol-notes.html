<p>
The provost of the University of Indiana says that <a target="_top" href="https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/index.html">perse would not
fire bigoted Professor Rasmusen for his bigotry</a> even if perse could.
</p><p>
What <a target="_top" href="https://stallman.org/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> will do is make sure that Rasmusen cannot grade students
based on bigotry, and that no student is required to take his classes.
</p><p>
I think this is the right way to deal with such situations.
Apparently Rasmusen's bigotry is extreme and unmistakable, but anyone
can make statements in which someone else will detect some sort of
stereotype, and could then be denounced as "racist" or "sexist".
It is right, it is crucial, to discourage bigotry without a witch hunt.

The bullshitter is trying to distract attention from his shakedown of
Ukraine by claiming this is a legitimate response to supposed
"Ukrainian election interference" in 2016. Some Republican officials
endorse this claim. However, US intelligence officials have told
senators that there was no such thing: rather, <a target="_top" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/ukraine-russia-interference.html">Putin is trying to
pin his own interference on Ukraine</a>.

Aside from that, even if Ukraine had tried to interfere in the US election
of 2016, that would be entirely irrelevant to the issue of the shakedown.

</p><p>
This may well be corruption in the narrowest moral sense; campaign
funds from the rich are effectively bribes. However, there is a
broader sense of corruption: even in the absence of an outright bribe,
the power of the rich corrupts Democracy. This meeting is certainly
a part of that.

There is a deeper fault in Black Friday: it focuses people's attention
on yearning to buy things they surely don't need. Some of the things
may be of actual use, and I wouldn't say nobody should buy any of them.
(Though some of them are full of proprietary malware <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/malware/proprietary-surveillance.html">which may spy on users</a>, or <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/malware/proprietary-drm.html">restrict them with DRM</a>, and nobody should buy those.)

Pardoning them was wrong ó war crimes call for punishment, and the US
usually fails to try the perpetrators.
</p><p>
Whether a politically controversial pardon should be grounds for
impeachment is a different question. I think a president ought to
pardon whistleblowers and journalists, including Edward Snowden and
Julian Assange. That too is politically controversial. Should a
president be impeached for pardoning them?
</p><p>
Should Governor Altgeld have been impeached for pardoning the union
leaders wrongly convicted of the Haymarket bombing? (Their "trial"
didn't try to prove they had anything to do with it.) He was quite
unpopular after pardoning them, but the act was not treated a crime.

<p>
Students that feel offended by expressions of bigotry at Syracuse
University demand that the chancellor obey their orders to the letter
in adopting measures to clamp down on it. They seem 
<a target="_top" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/syracuse-university-protests-chancellor-racist-incidents-kent-syverud">inclined
to engage in bullying unless they get their way</a>.
</p><p>
They rebuked the administration because it had to wait until morning
to address a reported 11:30pm SMS hate campaign, which ultimately
proved to have been a hoax (no one actually received the supposed
SMS). If it had really happened, it would be nasty, but not an
emergency. Such things can wait till morning.
</p><p>
Hitting back at hate in a direct way can backfire and promote hate.
It can also make society more repressive. Chancellor Syverud should
think carefully about how to discourage bigotry at Syracuse
University, and resist pressure to "repress someone right away." He
should refuse to be bullied, refuse to resign, think calmly, and aim
to reduce bigotry rather than trying to look tough.
</p><p>
The forms of bigotry present in Syracuse University include
antisemitism, and I am one of the people targeted by that. Speaking
as such, I call for the treatment to cure the disease of bigotry,
including antisemitism, not be more repressive than the disease
itself.

The article errs in equating Iranian influence with Shi'ite power.
The Shi'ites are the majority in Iraq, by far, and they will surely continue

effect is just the opposite.
</p><p>
When I was a child, occasionally the staff at a school or a summer
camp would grab me (they called it "restraining" me) with the absurd
idea that this would make me "calm down". What it did was enrage me.
As long as he kept trying to "restrain" me, I gave nonstop rage. I
made it absolutely clear that if he wanted me to "calm down" he must
first stop that aggression against me.
